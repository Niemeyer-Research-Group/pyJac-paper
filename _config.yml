title: pyJac: analytical Jacobian generator for chemical kinetics
abstract: "This site displays an automated build of the LaTeX source of the paper, which is hosted on GitHub."

# This controls which file is shown on the right-hand side of the published
# HTML page.  By default it will take the first PDF or HTML file that it
# finds.  If that doesn't work for you, you can specify the correct file here.
