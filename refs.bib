@article{Bisetti:2012jw,
	Annote = {time integration of chemical source terms as part of operator-splitting strategy: [4]

challenge of detailed kinetics:
  1) size: {\#} species/rxns affects memory and algorithmic costs
  2) stiffness: performance and robustness of time integration algorithm

real combustion fuels (e.g. gasoline, diesel, jet fuel) : long chain hydrocarbons
 - higher {\#} C atoms -{\&}gt; more species {\&}amp; rxns needed to describe
 - therefore, transportation fuels have hundreds-thousands

chemical kinetics for ignition {\&}amp; convective/diffusive low Mach {\#} combustion are stiff [9] (well recognized)
  - short time: QSS radical species, fast reversible PE rxns, {\&}amp; isomerization processes [10]
  - stiffness + as size + [11]
- using explicit methods prohibitive [12,13]

popular approach: BDF, use modified Newton's method, repeated solutions of linear systems (Jacobian matrix)
  - cost of finite difference Jacobian: K^2 (analytic: K.. use analytic Jacobian!)
  - cost of Jacobian factorization: K^3

 here: exponential integration methods (review [17])
  -use exponential-type fcns of Jacobian matrix to advance system of ODEs
  -for large stiff systems of ODEs, efficient alternative to std integrators [18]
  -however, for large dim system, cost assoc w exp fcn of Jacobian limits practicality

Krylov subspace method: calculate approximate and computational economical matrix fcns by projecting original matrix onto subspace of lower dim

exp methods w Krylov subspace projection used in quantum MD, incomp flows, model chem kin, optics, {\&}amp; MHD simulations

reasons well-suited:
* Krylov subspace methods: low-dim approx to Jacobian- local model reduction
* matrix-vector multiplications are basis, and large Jacobians are sparse
* exp int methods don't require direct solution of linear/nonlinear systems--no Jacobian factorizations, lower memory requirements

Jacobian using concentrations highly sparse: methyl decanoate (2878 spec) 0.54% sparsity
 - full for mass fractions

analytic Jacobian: symbolic differentiation

exponential integration: 
-exp4: 4th order, semi-implicit, 
    - modifies Rosenbrock-type method with an exp-based fcn of Jacobian matrix (Hockbruck et al [27])
 - algorithm cost: 7 matric-function vector products, 3 source vector evals, and 2 matrix-vector products
  * dominated by matrix fcn-vector products{\ldots} approximate these by Krylov subspace methods [19]

Krylov subspace approx [19]:
- don't need matrix, just action of matrix on vector
   - storage requirements reduced
-uses Arnoldi process to generate orthoganl basis of Krylov subspace
  * for sparse matrix, efficient matrix-vector products
  - expand matrix fcn-vector products as infinite series

[44] evaluating matrix functions more efficient

main components of approach:
1) exp4 method
2) Krylov approximant
3) direct matrix function eval

improvements:
- adaptive time-stepping
- variable order in response to local error estimates and user-defined tolerances

look at embedded methods of Hochbruck et al [27]
